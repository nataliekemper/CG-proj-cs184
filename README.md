Rasterizer: Vector graphics renderer capable of processing simplified scalable vector graphics (SVG) files. Includes features like drawing triangles, supersampling, hierarchical transforms, and texture mapping with antialiasing

Mesh Edit: Built Bezier curves and surfaces using de Casteljau algorithm, manipulated triangle meshes represented by half-edge data structure, and implemented loop subdivision

Pathtracer Pt1&2: Physically-based renderer employing a path tracing algorithm to render scenes with physical lighting and simulate materials like glass and metal

Cloth Sim: real-time simulation of cloth using a mass and spring based system to employ collisions, gravity, air friction, etc.. Applied numerical integration to simulate the way cloth moves over time
